My responsibilities are: checking the code and refactoring the old code using the MVP pattern using RxJava 2 and Dagger 2, as well as introducing new features and a new design in accordance with the requirements of Material Design. Interaction with  the Backend team to identify bugs and refine the REST API. Crashlytics and QA bug testing.

This application is an online client of the word and phrase generator for the pantomime game "Charades", located at: http://cr.flexo.name, therefore, a fully functional application requires Internet access.
A small database of words and phrases is built into the application, in case of temporary loss of the Internet.
Auto translation supported.

The software and mathematics (hereinafter referred to as PMO) "VOSTOK-2003" is developed on the basis of algorithms and software packages OSR-97 and provides a convenient user interface for specifying, editing and parameterizing zones of occurrence of earthquake sources, calculating the recurrence periods of the seismic effect and assessing seismic hazard, for constructing maps of probabilistic seismic zoning of specific territories, visualization of maps and other input, intermediate and output data.

PMO "EAST-2003" is supported by the Windows operating system, strictly corresponds to the OSR-97 methodology and includes the following main actions:
- selection of the research region, unification of the earthquake catalog, determination of the parameters of the seismic regime and the creation of other databases (DB) for the formation of the calculated linear-domain-focal model (LDF model) of the zones of occurrence of earthquake sources (WHO zones) and the parametrization of its main structural elements - lineaments, domains, potential foci of earthquakes;
- identification and inclusion in the database of geographical coordinates of the ends and kinks of linear zones reflecting structured seismicity (lineaments and potential foci), and kinks of contours of areal zones of diffuse seismicity (domains) with their corresponding seismological parameterization, which is carried out generally for each lineament and its segment , domain and potential source, including standardization of the density of seismic events per unit length (one km) for lineaments and unit area (one sq. km) for domains;
- visualization of maps of regional seismicity, mapping of extended and realistically oriented foci of earthquakes (in the OSR-97 legend - ellipses for magnitudes M≥6.8, etc.), the main structural elements of WHO zones (lineaments, domains, potential foci), active faults and others;
- creation of a model catalog on the basis of the parameterized model of the WHO zones, interactive formation of the coordinate grid and calculation of the repeatability of seismic tremors at its nodes, created by the main structural elements of the WHO zones - lineaments, domains and potential centers of earthquakes;
- visualization of the results of calculations of the frequency of occurrence of seismic tremors in nodes of the grid, virtual seismicity maps, maps of different periods of the frequency of occurrence of tremors of various seismic intensities, maps of seismic zoning for given periods of frequency of occurrence of seismic impacts, as well as the display of the main intermediate graphical constructions.

### Software developer (Windows MS Visual Studio C/C++)
## [ARMEKS](http://efir.sfu-kras.ru/)
#### Qualifications and skills:
- MS Visual Studio C/C++
- Assembler
- Translation of algorithms from Assembler (MS DOS) to C/C++
- MFC
- Hardware debugging

A set of programs for students to perform laboratory work in the discipline of  electrical engineering and electrical signals.  The main program synthesizes various types of signals, reads signals from an  external device in various modes, displays graphs of the synthesized signal, the  read signal after processing in the device. The program generates signals with  an amplitude characteristic, an amplitude-frequency characteristic, a  phase-frequency characteristic. 
Second program is designed to control an external device - an DAC-ADC converter  with electronic board layout (the real external device not emulation!)  
The third program allows to perform laboratory work remotely. The student  launched the program for remote work, formed a task (a script language specially  developed for this was used), this task was sent to the server (via e-mail or a  local network using). The server processed the incoming tasks using the FIFO  method and sent the results to the student. Thus, it was possible to reduce  travel costs for part-time students, as well as reduce the burden on teachers,  because laboratory work could be completed in advance before arriving at the  session.
