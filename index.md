- Assembler
- Translation of algorithms from Assembler (MS DOS) to C/C++
- MFC
- Hardware debugging

A set of programs for students to perform laboratory work in the discipline of  electrical engineering and electrical signals.  The main program synthesizes various types of signals, reads signals from an  external device in various modes, displays graphs of the synthesized signal, the  read signal after processing in the device. The program generates signals with  an amplitude characteristic, an amplitude-frequency characteristic, a  phase-frequency characteristic. 
 
Second program is designed to control an external device - an DAC-ADC converter  with electronic board layout (the real external device not emulation!)  The third program allows to perform laboratory work remotely. The student  launched the program for remote work, formed a task (a script language specially  developed for this was used), this task was sent to the server (via e-mail or a  local network using). The server processed the incoming tasks using the FIFO  method and sent the results to the student. Thus, it was possible to reduce  travel costs for part-time students, as well as reduce the burden on teachers,  because laboratory work could be completed in advance before arriving at the  session.
